        <h3> Nature</h3>
         <p>
        There is a great deal of talk and endeavour to protect nature, the animals,
        the birds, the whales and dolphins, to clean the polluted rivers, lakes, 
        fields and so on. Nature is not put together by thought, as religion and belief are.
        Nature is the tiger, that extraordinary animal with its energy, its great sense of power.
        Nature is the solitary tree in the field, the meadows and the grove; it is that squirrel shyly hiding behind a bough. Nature is the ant, the bee and all the living things of the earth. 
        Nature is the river, not a particular river, whether the Ganga, the Thames or the Mississippi.

        <h3> Mountains</h3>
        <p>
        Mountains are large landforms that rise prominently above their surroundings, usually having steep slopes and significant height. 
        They are formed through tectonic forces or volcanic activity and can be found all over the world. Mountains are important because 
        they influence climate and weather patterns and are home to diverse plants and animals.People enjoy visiting mountains for hiking, 
        skiing, and appreciating nature's beauty. They also provide fresh water as many rivers begin from mountain glaciers. Overall,
        rmountains are vital natural features that contribute greatly to Earth's environment and human life.
